Singleton

GoF's definition:

Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

The pattern allows:

    control over concrete class instantiating so that the only instance could be obtained.

Singleton is used to restrict instantiation of a class to one object.
This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

Singleton

GoF's definition:

Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

The pattern allows:

    control over concrete class instantiating so that the only instance could be obtained.

Registry itself is often considered as a pattern or even anti-pattern, but
shows how Singleton is used. 
exchange with states.. It's capable of keeping mixed types -
php magic methods ...

Obviously we have to ensure that whenever we refer to 
Registry we reach the same instance.

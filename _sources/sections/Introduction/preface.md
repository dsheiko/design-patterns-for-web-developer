When you study a pattern by a book such as [GoF](#ref-GoF) or [PoEAA](#ref-PoEAA)
it seems within your grasp. But as soon as you run into a task required the pattern
it brings many questions: "Is it really the very pattern for the case? 
Do I implement it aright? Did I get the pattern on the first place?"
I believe the best way to study software design patterns is implementing each in your 
preferred language on your specific tasks. For example if you take Bridge pattern
XWindow and PMWindow you unlikely to have such task in web-deve on the contrary 
themeng..

In my turn I made these examples in PHP and EcmaScript


So this is an online book on github to be continously updated

Inventor of design patterns Christopher Alexander has put it like that: 
“Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in 
our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that 
problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million 
times over, without ever doing it the same way twice”. He was no programmer, 
but an architect and anyway the definition is still true for object-oriented 
design pattern. The design patterns wide spread in software development 
after the “Gang of Four” (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides) 
published the book “Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software” with 
the original 23 design patterns. Since that different authors have been 
contributing to the list. 
Maybe, the most well-known example “Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture” 
by Martin Fowler. 

Design patterns describe object-oriented designs, but can be, theoretically, 
achieved on procedural languages. In that case there must be introduced 
additional patterns such as “Inheritance,” “Encapsulation,” and “Polymorphism.”

title: What Is a Design Pattern?
id: design-pattern-intro

Inventor of design patterns Christopher Alexander ([Alexander et al.]) has put it like that:
"Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in
our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that
problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million
times over, without ever doing it the same way twice". He was no programmer,
but an architect and anyway the definition is still true for software
architecture. Software design patterns have been applied practically for a long time, but
gained formalization of the concept and further popularity after the book "Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"
was published by so-called "Gang of Four" (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides).

Design patterns describe object-oriented designs, but can be, theoretically,
achieved on procedural languages. In that case there must be introduced
additional patterns such as "Inheritance," "Encapsulation," and "Polymorphism."
